  # developing
  
  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd train-check-client-v3
  yarn start

# deploying

```
yarn build
aero deploy
// go to https://train-check-3.aerobatic.io
```

## where to deploy

For now, I'm using aerobatic. But there are also these options:

- now.sh
- surge
- gitlab

## iphone/ios recognitions
